# scDCCA
We present a new deep contrastive clustering algorithm (scDCCA). scDCCA extracts valuable features and realizes cell segregation end-to-end by introducing dual contrastive learning and denoising ZINB model-based auto-encoder into a deep clustering framework. The results validate that ScDCCA outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, generalizability, scalability, and efficiency. 

See details in our paper: "scDCCA: Deep contrastive clustering for single-cell RNA-seq data based on auto-encoder network".
